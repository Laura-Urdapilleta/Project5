Computer Vision: Convolutional Neural Network

### Project Title
Paintings, Movies and Emotions: Deep Learning with CNN

### Description
I used Convolutional Neural Network with transfer learning (ResNet-101) and data augmentation to classify paintings according to the emotion they evoke in the observer. 

### Data Used
I used the dataset WikiArt Emotions, created by researchers at the National Research Council of Canada. This dataset contains 4,105 pieces of art annotated for up to 20 emotions evoked in the observer.\
